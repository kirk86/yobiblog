#init

Hi! Three years ago (when I decided to change my life and began converting myself from under-economist to the programmer) I started a blog on LiveJournal. The posts weren’t technical, I wrote about anything I experienced, thought about and wanted to share with others.

Now it’s the time to restart the blog from scratch. I still have no idea what it will be in the future, but here is the list of subjects which interest me a lot:

* brain and its modelling, cognition, artificial cognition and mind uploading
* artificial intelligence (especially strong one)
* computer vision
* science and rational thinking

Three years ago I had the Rule — to write a post every day (hadn't broken it for half a year, until the blog was closed). I don’t think it’s applicable to this blog, because I want posts to be more hardcore and useful than the previous one were (they were useful, of course, but more from the psychological point of view). This means more time for posts preparing and debugging. At first, as a rule, I'll try to write a post every week.

So, let this blog be the gratitude to the Universe for all the things I know to the present moment and my contribution to spreading the knowledge across the world. May the force be with you!
